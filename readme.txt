Use shortcode to embed graphs from IRC-Source.com

== Description ==

Use the shortcode `[ircsource-graph]` to embed graphs for your network. By default the network is AltSociety (my personal network) and the graphs show history for the current month.

Example usage:
`[ircsource-graph network="AltSociety" period="today" height="400px" width="100%"]`
